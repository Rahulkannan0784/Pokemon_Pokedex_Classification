PyPokeDex is a Python project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify Pokémon images. It distinguishes between different Pokémon species and provides information about them based on the image input.

## Features
- Classify Pokémon images as various species
- Provide information such as abilities, types, and base stats for recognized Pokémon
- Utilize a structured dataset split into training and test sets for model training
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Structured dataset containing images of various Pokémon species
